## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/pincher-controller.git

# Enter the magical directory
cd pincher-controller

# Install dependencies (results in computer understanding sign language)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the wizard
python pincher_controller.py
```

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam (preferably one that doesn't make you look like a potato)
- Functioning hands (at least one)
- A voice (any accent is fine, the computer doesn't judge)
- Patience (lots of it for the first few minutes)
- A willingness to explain to passersby that no, you're not having a seizure

## How to Actually Use This Thing ü§î

1. Run the script and position yourself in front of your webcam
2. Show an open palm to activate tracking mode
3. Make a pinching gesture with your thumb and index finger to control the cursor
4. Make an OK sign to click
5. When clicking on a text field, voice recognition activates automatically
6. Speak clearly (or don't, and enjoy autocorrect fails)
7. Use the rock gesture to press Enter when done
8. Feel like Tony Stark in Iron Man (superhero suit not included)

## Advanced Techniques for Power Users üî•

- Perfect the art of the "urgent pinch" when your cursor isn't moving fast enough
- Master the "panic palm" when things start clicking on their own
- Develop your "whisper dictation" for those confidential emails
- Learn the "gesture combo breaker" for when you need to quickly copy-paste-enter
- Practice your "casual gesture conversation," where you control your computer while appearing to have a normal conversation using Italian hand gestures

## Troubleshooting üîß

**Q: Why is my cursor going crazy?**  
A: Are you in an Italian restaurant? Your expressive hand gestures while discussing pasta might be confusing the system.

**Q: The voice recognition typed "buy 17 llamas" instead of "schedule a meeting"?**  
A: The system might be trying to make your life more interesting. Consider the llama option.

**Q: My coworkers are looking at me strangely?**  
A: That's not a technical problem. That's envy.

**Q: Can I type passwords with voice recognition?**  
A: Yes, but shouting "MY PASSWORD IS FLUFFY123!" across the office is not recommended for security reasons.

*Note: Pincher Controller may cause increased self-consciousness about hand gestures during regular conversations. Side effects include occasionally pinching the air while trying to change TV channels and making OK signs at inanimate objects. Use responsibly.*

**Remember:** With great power comes great opportunity to look silly in front of your webcam. Embrace it!
